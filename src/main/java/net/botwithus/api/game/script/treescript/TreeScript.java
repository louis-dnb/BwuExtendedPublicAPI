 * An abstract implementation of a TreeScript that extends from the Script class. This class is designed
 * to facilitate the use of a tree-based task structure within the context of a script. It holds a reference
 * to a root task that acts as an entry point to the task tree. The task tree is traversed in the onLoop method.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must provide the root task through the implementation of getRootTask method. The root task should
 * be a BranchTask that serves as the starting point of the task tree.
 * <p>
 * A TreeScript may be used for structuring complex or dynamic scripts, where the script behavior may need
 * to change depending on various conditions (represented by the validation of tasks in the tree).
